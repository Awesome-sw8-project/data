# Data

To use this repository, download the kaggle data for the 'Indoor Location & Navigation' competition and unzip the data in the root folder of this repository.

The dataAnalysis.py file is used for the Data Analysis section in the report. This file is used to generate graphs such as the distribution of paths and sites over the different floor levels.

The dataPre.py file is used to preprocess the data from the Train folder of the Kaggle Competition dataset. This preprocessing concerns both cleaning the data and reformatting it to the desired format for the data pipeline.

The testPre.py file is used to preprocess the Test data from the competition to follow a similar structure to the data generated by the dataPre.py file.
