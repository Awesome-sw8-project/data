# Data

To use this repo the download the kaggle data for the 'Indoor Location & Navigation' competition. The zip file has to be unzip in the root folder of this repo. 

The dataAnalysis.py file is used to produce graphs for the report... and it is ugly :3

The dataPre.py file is used to preprocess the data for the pipeline and it is a little better :D
